This repository contains the code for the optimisation of a one-stage machine allocation and sequencing problem (job-shop) by the simulated annealing method.
I used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the state update and Hamiltonian with symmetry-broken structure with respect to tardiness and earliness.
